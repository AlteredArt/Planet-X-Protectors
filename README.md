  ### `npm start`
  
  Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  
  The page will reload when you make changes.\
  You may also see any lint errors in the console.
  This is a demonstration of the project
  
  # Startup Install
  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
  See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
  
  ### `npm run build`
  
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  
  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
  Your app is ready to be deployed!
  
  See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
  
  ### `npm run eject`
  
  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
  
  If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.
  
  Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.
  
  You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Planet X Protectors
Good morning, you live on a planet far far in the deep reaches of space. This morning our radar detectors have a mass swarm of space beetles outside of our normal asteroid attacks. 

We need you at the helm to keep the beetles at bay.

Please man the turret on the rocket an keep those damn bugs at bay!

Make sure you remove at least 20 beetles, while we prepare our bombs.
